# Embedded-Systems-Space-Invaders
This Embedded System Space Invaders minigame is a full fledged system that is built on parts of other projects. It is a demonstration of my learning and experience with embedded systems. This contains elements of hardware systems of DAC, ADC as well as software implementations such as real-time system design and the design of certain sprite displays.
